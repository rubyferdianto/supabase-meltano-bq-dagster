-- GEOGRAPHIC MARKET ANALYTICS OBT
-- =============================================================================
-- Business Purpose: Geographic market analysis and regional performance insights
-- Grain: One row per geographic market segment (state/region level)
-- Update Frequency: Daily
-- 
-- IMPORTANT NOTE: Customer counts are by state activity, not unique customers.
-- Customers who place orders from multiple states are counted in each state.
-- Expected: 95,419 unique customers → 95,538 total state-customer relationships
-- This includes ~37 customers active in multiple states (normal business behavior)
